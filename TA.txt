Sample text file.
Made to test text editor at various stages of development.
Text Editor is names TA (for now, waiting for a better one), based on initials of individuals this project belongs to.

Now some random text -

Ya, that should be enough.

TO COMPILE (LINUX), Series of commands -
1. (CD in folder TextEditor_TA)
2. make TA
3. ./TA TA.txt
(different file names can be used. file with extensions with .c, .cpp, .h will give best results. if no file name is used, a new empty file will be opened.)
